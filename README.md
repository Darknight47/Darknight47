### Game Development With:
* I studied game development at high school (3 years) and developed many games, mostly 2D games!
* Between 2019 and 2023, I had been teaching and developing studio material for an organisation called HelloWorld!. It’s a non-profit that focused on introducing coding and computer science to young students.
* Nowadays I go back to game development and working on a project as soon as I find free time!
